# Nand2Tetris Project

Implementation of a computer following the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course.

## Project Overview

This repository contains my implementations for the Nand2Tetris projects. Starting from basic NAND gates, I construct a complete computer hardware platform and software hierarchy.

**Note:** I'm dividing this into two parts since I'm a first-year CS student and don't want to rush to the software part just yet. This repository will likely be inactive for a while after I finish the Hardware portion (Projects 1-5) of the course.

## Project Structure

The course is divided into 12 projects:

### Hardware Projects
- **Project 01**: Boolean Logic  
  *Basic logic gates built from NAND gates*
- **Project 02**: Boolean Arithmetic  
  *ALU, adder, and arithmetic units*
- **Project 03**: Sequential Logic  
  *Memory chips: registers, RAM*
- **Project 04**: Machine Language  
  *Low-level programming*
- **Project 05**: Computer Architecture  
  *CPU and complete computer*

### Software Projects
- **Project 06**: Assembler  
  *Symbolic machine code translator*
- **Project 07**: Virtual Machine I  
  *Stack arithmetic and memory access*
- **Project 08**: Virtual Machine II  
  *Program control and function calling*
- **Project 09**: High-Level Language  
  *Jack programming language*
- **Project 10**: Compiler I  
  *Syntax analysis and tokenization*
- **Project 11**: Compiler II  
  *Code generation*
- **Project 12**: Operating System  
  *Math, memory, and I/O libraries*
