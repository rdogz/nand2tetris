# Nand2Tetris Project

Implementation of a computer following [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course.

## Project Overview

This repository contains my implementations for the Nand2Tetris projects. Starting from basic NAND gates, I construct a complete computer hardware platform and software hierarchy.

Will divide in 2 parts, since I'm a first-year CS student and don't want to rush to the software part just yet. So this will likely be innactive for a while after I finnish the Hardware part of the course.

## Project Structure

- **Project 01**: Boolean Logic
  - Basic logic gates built from NAND gates

- **Project 02**: Boolean Arithmetic
  - ALU, adder, and arithmetic units

- **Project 03**: Sequential Logic
  - Memory chips: registers, RAM

- **Project 04**: Machine Language
  - Low-level programming

- **Project 05**: Computer Architecture
  - CPU and complete computer

- **Project 06**: Assembler
  - Symbolic machine code translator

- **Project 07**: Virtual Machine I
  - Stack arithmetic and memory access

- **Project 08**: Virtual Machine II
  - Program control and function calling

- **Project 09**: High-Level Language
  - Jack programming language

- **Project 10**: Compiler I
  - Syntax analysis and tokenization

- **Project 11**: Compiler II
  - Code generation

- **Project 12**: Operating System
  - Math, memory, and I/O libraries
