The hardest part of this project was figuring out how to load the assembly file into the cpu emulator using their IDE. Turns out you gotta write to their Mult.asm, I was just loading the file from my computer hoping it would load, but as soon as I loaded the test script, all of my assembly code disapeared. Anyway.

You kind of have to load the values into the register first before doing math or logical operations. Cannot load straight out of RAM except for the virtual registers (R0 - R15?). Easy enough, just had to get used to the syntax. The current implementation had  a complexity of O(n), meaning the number of iterations depends on how large the summation is. I know there's a more efficient algo, but for now this will suffice for the purpose of the project.
