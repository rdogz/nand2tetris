Easy. just link 3 chips I already build had (ROM was given for free, but still).

Project 5 is now concluded. I must now study calculus. I'll be back next year, maybe earlier, maybe later. 

For the next projects there's a lot of compiler stuff and what seems like math-heavy projects. I must get stronger. I'll train. I'll be back. I feel victorious though. From Nand to Computer.

Yay!
