The most time consuming one. It was not hard but it was very tiresome and one mistake would break the whole thing. I finally finished it in a not efficient way. I gotta go back here and try to make it better in the future. Right now it works, but had so many complex circuits that could be simplified. I worked on this from 10am to 01am of the other day. A lot of stuff was done while I was too tired to think right so I ended up making a huge mess. I know I can simplify this in the future. btw I'm writting this at 11am of the next day. I slept and was able to patch a few bugs that were making it not work correctly. I used a wrong variable in the mux at the end, I used a incorrect zeroing instead of comparing each subsequent value I was just comparing them all to false. The ng was pretty easy since I was already used to 2s complement form the csapp book. Anyway gotta patch the babe later to make it more efficient.
